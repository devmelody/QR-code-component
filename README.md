### What I learned

I learnt about media queries, box-sizing and responsiveness to mention a few. 


```css
@media (min-width: 500px) {
    .container{ width: 300px;}
}
```


### Continued development

I'm still working on responsiveness and sizing. I hope to practice with more projects and become an expert at it swiftly.


### Useful resources

- [Thomas Sankara Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com) - This helped me in determining size and responsiveness. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
